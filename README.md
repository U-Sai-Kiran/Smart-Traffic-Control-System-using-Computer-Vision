# Smart-Traffic-Control-System-using-Computer-Vision
Using Canny Edge Detection | Python | OpenCV | Streamlit

📌 Project Overview
This project is a computer vision–based traffic analysis system that detects vehicles and estimates traffic density using Canny Edge Detection and Region of Interest (ROI) analysis.
A Streamlit web interface is built to provide real-time visualization and an interactive user experience.
The system helps in understanding lane-wise traffic congestion, which can be extended to adaptive traffic signal control.

🎯 Key Features
🔍 Canny Edge Detection for vehicle outline extraction
📸 Reference Image Comparison for density calculation
🛣️ Lane-wise ROI Density Analysis
🚗 Vehicle Detection using Bounding Boxes
📊 Traffic Density Estimation (Low / Medium / High)
🖥️ Interactive GUI Interface
🌐 Streamlit Web Application for easy deployment

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Streamlit
Computer Vision: Canny Edge Detection
Frontend: Streamlit UI
Deployment: Local / Streamlit Cloud

⚙️ How It Works
The system processes a traffic image by converting it to grayscale and applying Canny Edge Detection to highlight vehicle edges. A predefined lane-wise ROI is analyzed and compared with a reference image to calculate pixel density and estimate traffic congestion levels. Vehicles are detected using contour analysis and highlighted with bounding boxes, and all results are displayed through an interactive Streamlit web interface.
